## GraphQL (GQL)
* is a query language
* more flexible and efficient than REST
* REST has different endpoints for different resources
* GQL has single endpoint for multiple resources
* you can be selective of what in return, instead of getting entire data in response
* GQL is platform agnostic

### REST Vs GQL
* Client requests several AJAX requests to REST endpoints, multiple endpoints for different resources
* Requesting for particular data is tricky in REST as we have ":id" based endpoints  
* While GQL we can define a query with what data we want and can expect data which we asked for


## The Mini Fullstack Application
* NodeJs, Express, GraphQL
* MongoDB (mlab)
* React (Apollo)
* Graphiql
